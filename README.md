This thesis deals with text processing, stylometry and issues surrounding fake news. Nowadays some fake news are becoming viral where they can manipulate the masses. They may often have quite a significant impact so it is important to stop them from spreading before they can reach a lot of people. We focused on the authors of these fake news. We also addressed the topic of machine learning models with which we determined whether an article was fake or true. Various text processing techniques like stemming and lemmatization and also various approaches to feature extraction, specifically Bag of words and TFIDF, were applied. Combinations of these techniques and approaches were subjected to experiments with the aim of finding the best performing classification model. Features used in classification were analyzed to find common features and characteristics of fake news articles.
